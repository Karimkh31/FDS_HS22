Since the IRIS data already given from the library, they were just passed to the function 
to run the experiment.
 
For the voting data, first, y & n chars were replaced with 1 & 9 in order to run the 
NBC fit and predict function -, also, one can change the labels from strings to 0,1 
but, the NBC was implemented in a way to predict and return the classes themselves and not there
position, e.g. with numpy return our_classes[argmax(predictions)], or with pandas by returning the classes, 
that yields the higher prediction. Then, all rows with missing values were dropped. Finally, the data 
were passed to the experiment function, and there the data were first shuffled, splitted in train 
and test and passed to the inner loop, where the 2 models were trained and tested against increasing
amount of data points.
